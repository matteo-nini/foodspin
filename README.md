### Description and technologies

Based on the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XJqJJQ35oc), i want to to recrerate the project! I Just download the Figma file created by the user and start coding it, using just _HTML5_, _CSS3_ and _JavaScript_!

### How i made it

I've used **Trello** for organize tasks, and after a project analysis, i've just start studing _math_ :worried: for understand how to position each dish on the spinner wheel. After it, i've create a JS file `initSpinner.js` where i write (obv) initialize the spinner with dishes on it :white*check_mark: <br/>
After this, i've just positioning all the elements (at the very first time, i've use `absolute` position, but for a \_better experience*, i've converted all with **`Flexbox`**). <br/>
Now it's all positioned! <br/> **WELL DONE, MY MAN!** :punch: <br/><br/>
_And now it's time for the magic!_<br/>
Combining _JS_ and _CSS3_ i've added some beautiful **animations**, and all works well, i guess.
<br/><br/>
I'm now working on _CSSs media queries_ for give a nice experience in all devices, but if you want to have a look at the project, you can find it at the link below!

**Have a great spinning** :wink:<br>
